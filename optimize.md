# Website Optimization Checklist

This document outlines the optimization tasks for the Access Global Foundation website. Tasks are organized by priority and category.

## Priority 1: Critical Performance Improvements

### Build & Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Configure Vite for production builds
  - [ ] Enable minification and tree-shaking
  - [ ] Configure chunk splitting strategy
  - [ ] Add compression (gzip/Brotli)
- [ ] Audit and optimize dependencies
  - [ ] Remove unused dependencies
  - [ ] Update outdated packages
  - [ ] Consider lighter alternatives where possible

### Image Optimization
- [ ] Set up image optimization pipeline
  - [ ] Add `vite-plugin-image-optimizer`
  - [ ] Convert all images to WebP with fallbacks
  - [ ] Implement responsive images with `srcset`
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation
  - [ ] Native lazy loading for images below the fold
  - [ ] Implement `react-lazy-load-image-component` for more control

## Priority 2: Core Web Vitals

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- [ ] Route-based code splitting with `React.lazy()`
- [ ] Component-level code splitting for large components
- [ ] Lazy load non-critical components

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
- [ ] Set up performance budgets
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring tools (Sentry/LogRocket)

## Priority 3: User Experience

### React Performance
- [ ] Implement `React.memo` for pure components
- [ ] Optimize state updates with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- [ ] Virtualize long lists with `react-window` or `react-virtualized`

### Animation & Interaction
- [ ] Optimize animations with `will-change` and `transform`
- [ ] Implement intersection observer for scroll-based animations
- [ ] Defer non-critical animations

## Priority 4: Network & Caching

### Service Workers & Caching
- [ ] Implement service worker with Workbox
- [ ] Configure cache strategies for static assets
- [ ] Implement offline fallback page

### CDN & Asset Delivery
- [ ] Configure CDN for global asset delivery
- [ ] Set up proper cache headers
- [ ] Implement resource hints (`preconnect`, `preload`, `prefetch`)

## Priority 5: Advanced Optimizations

### Server-Side Optimizations
- [ ] Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Implement API response compression

### Progressive Enhancement
- [ ] Implement skeleton loading states
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for older browsers

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated performance testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
