# Access Global Project Review

## Overall Impression
Access Global ships as a full-stack donation and storefront platform with a Vite-based React frontend and an Express/Stripe backend bundled for container-friendly deployment. The README outlines the tech stack (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Wouter, Radix) and deployment expectations, including build/start commands and required environment variables for Coolify-style hosting, which sets a solid operational baseline.【F:README.md†L1-L76】

## Frontend Highlights
The client application wires a comprehensive navigation tree covering marketing pages, donation flows, blog posts, team profiles, and the ecommerce experience (storefront, product detail, cart, order success, and admin) while providing shared UI like navigation, footer, toast notifications, tooltips, and a floating donate button via the central `App.tsx` router composition.【F:client/src/App.tsx†L1-L84】
Cart state is encapsulated in a dedicated context that persists to `localStorage`, enforces a BOGO-style bundle discount, and exposes helpers for quantity, subtotal, and total management—evidence of thoughtful client-side commerce logic.【F:client/src/contexts/CartContext.tsx†L1-L161】

## Backend Highlights
The Express server layers Stripe webhooks, NOWPayments crypto IPN handling, donation CRUD endpoints, and a robust store checkout that validates inventory, enforces bundle pricing, records orders, and provisions Stripe Checkout sessions with enriched metadata for fulfillment follow-up.【F:server/index.js†L1-L200】【F:server/index.js†L360-L739】
Product catalog and order APIs exist for both public access and admin-only operations via a header-protected middleware, indicating readiness for basic storefront management tooling.【F:server/index.js†L49-L739】

## Documentation & Operational Support
Documentation is extensive: the implementation summary enumerates key features, configuration tasks, testing utilities, and live launch steps, while the donation flow guide provides a donor-facing walkthrough, security assurances, and troubleshooting pointers. Together they dramatically lower the barrier for onboarding developers and non-technical stakeholders alike.【F:IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md†L1-L200】【F:DONATION_FLOW_GUIDE.md†L1-L160】

## Opportunities for Future Polish
* Tighten README and top-level docs to eliminate minor formatting glitches (e.g., truncated sentences) for polish and clarity.
* Consider extracting pricing rules (like the $50 bundle pairs) into shared config consumed by both client and server to keep promotions in sync.
* Evaluate adding automated tests or linting hooks; the codebase is substantial enough that a CI safety net would pay dividends during future iterations.
